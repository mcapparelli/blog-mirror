# How I Became A Metaverse Artist

We all have that very special person that introduces us to something new, unknown or undiscovered. In my case, it all started around 10 years ago when I attended an event organized by students of our university, where we studied Software Engineering. A few minutes into what was a great conversation I realized that we shared a genuine interest in art. It all started there! A few months ago I was invited to join an adventure:  

Create a 3D sculpture defined by the real time data of the crypto market, to be presented on Decentraland Metaverse Art Week 2022.

## Tauromaquia is Born

Tauromaquia is an immersive, interactive data sculpture inspired by a bull-fighting scene. Bull-fighting, in Spanish *Tauromaquia*, is a cruel and medieval form of entertainment. The analogy represents how greed deforms us and makes us, as the bull, a victim of a larger form of speculative entertainment.

## Under the Hood

The scene is composed of four main entities: the bull, bleachers, coins, and data-walls. Some of these entities may mutate their shape and size depending on the scene’s state. The state swaps, every 5 seconds, between the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranked by their total value, which means that the first place is taken by the biggest market cap. For each of them there are two main indexes calculated:  

- Percentage price variation in the last 30 days.  
- Percentage price variation in the last hour.  

### The Bull

In the center of the arena you can find the MVP of the scene: the bull. The bull’s size depends on the position of the current cryptocurrency in the ranking — the higher the rank, the bigger the bull becomes. But size is not the only metric used to define its shape. It also has an in-and-out animation.  

- **In-animation:** defined by the last 30 days price variation.  
- **Out-animation:** defined by the last hour price variation.  

This represents the market’s mood for that currency in a 5-second time capsule.  

### The Coins

400 coins are randomly distributed over the arena, but what makes them special is the way they move. Coins oscillate vertically following Bitcoin’s market cap variation of the last 90 days, which creates a rain-like effect. If you were to plot the ups and downs over an X and Y plot, you’d end up with something very similar. Three coin shapes are connected to the bull’s mood: flowers, silver, and red coins.  

### The Bleachers and Data-Walls

The bleacher is a massive conical structure around the arena. Thanks to its anatomy it offers multiple perspectives of the scene by standing on it while the spectator enjoys the experience. And last but not least, the data-walls are a matrix-style light effect accomplished by overlapping multiple text layers.

## Last Few Words…

This experience could not have been accomplished without the vision of the team that made it possible. I’m grateful not only for being invited into this journey but also for being pushed to blend two of my passions: web development and art. It is not something that happens every day — to have someone come to you and say:  
> “Let’s build a 3D experience for the metaverse, with a bull deformed by real time crypto data.”  

It sounds crazy, YES! But here I am, more than happy about what we built! This is only our way of representing the web3 mood. We focused on some aspects that we considered relevant to highlight what we want to show, but there’s a huge ocean of possibilities of what could be done.  

So, what are you waiting for?  
I hope to see you at Tauromaquia!
